# Word Game

## Purpose

I wanted to practice my front-end web development skills in a fun way by creating a game. This game is based on the popular Wordle.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used

Next.js 13 with the new app directory was used as the backbone for this project.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling of this project.

Testing of game logic code was done with Jest.

This project was coded using TypeScript.
